autoscaling in azure --> https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/cloud/azure/autoscaling-in-microsoft-azure/
	
	Autoscaling provides the capability to run your application or workload 
with the required resources (resources, in this case, are virtual machines) 
without interruption. It assures you that the virtual machines you requested
for your application are always available and up. If the virtual machines 
are interrupted, autoscaling replaces those faulty virtual machines with
new ones.

Continuous deployment in devops

	Continuous deployment is a software development method that releases 
or deploys software automatically into the production environment. In this 
model, no one manually checks the code and pushes into your app.
	It uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase are 
correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production 
environment.
