Azure Web App - Deployment Slots (Available in standard or premium Plans)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	so first we have developed a app and deployed it lets say 
        Version 1.
	When we updated some features in it we call it version 2.

So inorder to deploy the version 2 we have two options

	Option-1
	--------
 + Create another azure web app service.
 + deploy version 2 in it.

	Option-2
	--------
 So instead of creating another Azure web app service
 we have a option in Azure web app called deployment slots
 Here in deployment slots we have
	+ Production slot
	+ Staging slot
 By default when we deploy the version 1 it goes into the production slot
 
 So when ever we have a update like version 2 we can deploy it into Staging slots

 Staging Slots
 -------------
 + We have sepearte domain names for Staging and production slots
 + So the users can use the production slot with its domain name url and
   we can test our version 2 with its domain name url
 + So when our version 2 is tested and ready to deploy we can just swap
   the both slots
		So that production slot now has version 2 and will be used
		by the user and staging will have version 1
 + if we have bugs in version 2 after deployment we can just swap it with version 1

 Advantages
 ----------
 + It helps to eliminate the downtime of our applications for 
   version updates
 + We can easily roll back changes.


 Steps
 -----
1) Go to Deployment Slots in Deployment
2) If plan is not standard or premium Plan than 
   update it( in scale up in settings)
3) Click on Add Slot
4) Give the name and press on add
5) Click on the newly added slot we will have everything 
   like a new Azure web app
6) Now publishing version 2 from vs select this staging slot and publish it.
   
	So now production slot has version 1
	And staging slot has version 2

 Swapping of Production and staging Slots
 -------------------------------------------
1) Go to any one slot either production or staging 
2) Click on Swap
3) Select source url and target url
4) Click swap
	
	So now production slot has version 2
	And deployment slot has version 1

PowerShell commands for Azure Web Apps
---------------------------------------

1)// First you can go ahead and create variables that can be used 
  in the PowerShell script. Here we are setting the location for 
  the web application, the name of a new resource group and the name 
  of the new Azure Web App

	$location="Central US"

	$resourcegrp="newgrp"

	$webappname="demoapp4040"


2)// Next we issue the command to create a new resource group

	New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourcegrp -Location $location

3)// Next we issue the command to create a new App Service Plan

	New-AzAppServicePlan -Name $webappname -Location $location -ResourceGroupName $resourcegrp -Tier Standard

4)// Next we issue the command to create a new Web App

	New-AzWebApp -Name $webappname -Location $location -ResourceGroupName $resourcegrp -AppServicePlan $webappname

5)// Next we issue the command to create a new Web App deployment slot

	New-AzWebAppSlot -Name $webappname -ResourceGroupName $resourcegrp -Slot "staging"
