Azure Web App - AutoScaling ( available for standard plan and higher)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Autoscaling is not available in Basic Plan
- In Basic plan we have to do Manual scaling(upto 3 VM's)

In standard and above plans we have Autoscaling
+ Here we need to write rules and conditions to trigger the scaling
+ we can do scale out and scale in

 eg., like if the cpu goes beyond certain limit it can scale out(add VM's)
      if load decreases it can scale in(remove VM's) thus reducing cost


  Steps
  -----
 1) Go to scale out
 2) we have two options 
	a) Manual Scaling
	b) Custom AutoScale
 3) Select Custom Autoscale
 4) In default section 
	We can scale based on metric or based on instance count
	We can add a rule
		We can select any metric source
		Based on Metric source we can add a rule
		If the metric source is our Service PLAN
			we have operator section where we ,can specify
			Greater than or less than values of threshold
		We can increase the count by 1 or our own 
	We have Cool down period which means time taken to distribute the 
	load amoung the VM's.
 5) We have minimum and maximum instances in default section.
